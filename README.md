# Smartwatch Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing data collected from a smartwatch. The analysis includes exploring various health metrics such as heart rate, steps, sleep patterns, and activity levels. The goal is to provide insights into the wearer's health and wellness over time.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and normalization of data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and patterns in health data.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using machine learning models to predict health outcomes based on smartwatch data.
- **Insights**: Key insights and recommendations based on the analyzed data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains measurements from a smartwatch, including:
- Heart rate
- Number of steps
- Sleep duration
- Activity levels (e.g., sedentary, active, etc.)
- Date and time of measurements


Step 1: Data Preprocessing
This section handles missing values, normalizes data, and prepares it for further analysis.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize trends and patterns in the smartwatch data, such as:

Heart rate trends over time
Steps taken each day
Sleep patterns
Step 3: Predictive Modeling
Using machine learning models to predict health outcomes like possible heart rate anomalies, activity levels, etc.

Results
The analysis provides insights on the user's health, such as:

Identifying abnormal heart rate patterns.
Understanding sleep behavior.
Suggesting improvements based on activity levels
